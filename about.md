## Background Information

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/pic04.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

Water ecological construction is becoming increasingly more challenging due to the demands of a growing population and the complexity of the water resource management infrastructure. Accordingly, there is an ever increasing need for water providers and public authorities to be able to critically predict, manage and monitor the status of water ecology to enable more effective decision making. The project will focus on the application of machine learning and spatio-temporal data visualization techniques with predictive analytics in response to temporal changes in water ecological process enabling continuous water resource monitoring and optimisation. Ningbo Water Resource Bureau provides the project with real big data for the water ecological construction.

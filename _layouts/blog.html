This is a paragraph that goes on the right side of an image. This is the text that goes under the heading and the subtitle. Paragraphs vary in length but in school we're taught to make them at least 7 sentences or else we risk getting a C. Since the paragraph didn't have a thesis or a closing argument, it's probably a C grade paragraph.</p>
